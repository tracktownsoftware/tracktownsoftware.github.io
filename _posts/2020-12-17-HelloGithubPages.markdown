# New goal for 2021
Going into 2021 my goal is to share more sample code in Github repositories, and document the *new thing* I learned in a blog. There are development tools and frameworks that I use infrequently, so at minimum my blog will offer a refresher when I have to revisit a project.

# Moving my website to GitHub Pages
Before [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) I used to host my website on [DiscountASP.NET](https://www.discountasp.net/). I began going down the path of implementing my own blog in ASP.NET but then decided why go to the trouble when I can just host it on GitHub.

There's a lot of information available for making your own GitHub Pages blog with Jekyll, so I won't document the steps here. Below are some useful links to step you through the entire process.

The one issue I ran into: The Jekyll static site generator required installing Ruby onto my Windows 10 Pro v1909 computer. RubyInstaller ver 2.7 didn't seem to install correctly, so I uninstalled it and found success with RubyInstaller ver 2.6.

# Development environment for my Github Pages website
I use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to open and edit my GitHub Pages project folder. VSCode supports Git actions by clicking on icons in the project Explorer window, but I prefer typing Git commands into a VSCode terminal Bash window.
