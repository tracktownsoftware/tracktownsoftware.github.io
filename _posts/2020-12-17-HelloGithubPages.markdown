# New goal for 2021
Going into 2021 my goal is to share more sample code in Github repositories, and document what I learned in a blog. There are development tools and frameworks that I use infrequently, so at minimum my blog will offer a refresher when I have to revisit a project.

# Moving my website to GitHub Pages
Before [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) I hosted my website on [DiscountASP.NET](https://www.discountasp.net/). I began implementing my blog in ASP.NET but then decided it would be simpler to host it on GitHub Pages with the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) static site generator.

There's a lot of information online for making your own GitHub Pages blog with Jekyll, so I won't document the steps here. Below are some useful links to step you through the entire process.

The one issue I ran into: Jekyll required installing Ruby onto my Windows 10 computer. RubyInstaller ver 2.7 didn't seem to install correctly, so I uninstalled it and found success with RubyInstaller ver 2.6.

# Development environment for my website
I use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to open and edit the project folder in my Git local repository. VSCode supports Git actions by clicking on icons in the project Explorer window, but I prefer typing Git commands into a VSCode terminal Bash window.
